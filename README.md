## Project Details 
This JavaFx Application mirrors a pharmacy system which users can access
whether they are employees or clients. </br>
Each user has access to certain features of the app, based on their account
status (employee/client) and security clearance if they're an employee. For
example, a manager has access to the business' finances, while a
pharmacist doesn't. A pharmacist, however, has access to stock levels in
order to restock ones that are running out; as well as the inventory status of
an item (defected, expired, etc.). A client user can place orders to be
delivered to their home.
